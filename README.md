Contains all the code for 3 projects in CS440_Intro_to_AI @ Rutgers

**Fire_Spread_Bot**
* Implemented Pathfinding algorithms (BFS and A* algorithms) to find the shortest path on a 2D grid
* Utilized modified cost functions to change decision-making in pathfinding

**Ship_Leak_Bot** 
* Implemented A* pathfinding algorithm on a 2D grid
* Created a fully functioning Bayesian Network
* Utilized conditional probability, conditional factoring, and marginalization to influence decision-making in pathfinding
* Implemented local-search hill-climbing algorithm

**Wire_ML**
* Coded a fully function Neural Network from Scratch
* Neural Network used to classify labeled images of a set of four wires as either **safe** or **unsafe**
* Built a separate neural network to tell us which wire to cut to make an **unsafe** image **safe**
* Achieved **99.4%** accuracy in the binary classification task based on 500,000 unseen images.
* Acheived **99.7%** accuracy in the m-ary classification task based on 500,000 unseen images.
* Preprocessed images using computer vision and extracting information only from the intersections of wires.
